The fact is, those within the LGBTQ+ community are more likely to commit suicide than Cis and Straight people. We deserve a future too, every single person deserves the right to a future.

My chest is big and usually the first thing people see and make assumptions on my gender because of. Being someone who is Non-binary with chest dysphoria but can't bind is very difficult. I've always struggled with accepting and loving my body fat and stretch marks, especially with all the fatphobia in the world, especially in the medical field. Being non-binary has its own unique difficulties that are hard to navigate, and being a more feminine person is often difficult when the idea of androgyny is often forced upon those who do not fit within the binary.
